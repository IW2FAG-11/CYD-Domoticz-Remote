WIP project to control Domoticz with a CYD.

To make short I was searching a small wall mounted touchscreen to control my home, with low consumption enought to be powered all the time.   
It use Wifi connection to connect direclty to domoticz, to ask information and use the websocket connexion to have real time event, so nothing to add. Just power the device using USB, give the Domoticz IP the wifi password and it's all.   
In reality the project is not finished so lot of settings are hard coded on the device, for exemple wich one devices will be displayed on the homepage, but it already work in stand alone mode.
